ABOUT

"Simple" V4L2 Webcam Viewer, based on QT4. ( 4.1.1 ) 

It use libv4lconvert for converting between formats. ( you need this ,
download it from http://people.atrpms.net/~hdegoede/libv4l-0.5.1.tar.gz or
from lastest tarball on linuxtv.org/  ( i test with http://linuxtv.org/hg/~jfrancois/gspca/ )


Some of the code needs a really clean up, and also brake any rules of
patterns, since i merged part of old code i was using for another subprojects.

The application supports plugins for effects, and any kind of service
someone could develop for. Keep in mind that, processing images ( adding
effects for example ) while streaming could decrease a lot of fps. 

Video Record, is also supported if you have installed: ( won't be enabled if
you dont )
